                  Once your registration and payment have been confirmed, you will automatically be added to the attendees' mailinglist. The addition to this mailing list is your final confirmation of your registration.

                <p id="words" class="smallerwords">
                  

                  The registration fee depends on the type of registration. It must be paid in advance (excluding the pay-at-the-door type) using one of the approved methods. Once your payment has completed, you will receive a PDF copy of your receipt using email, and it will also be available for download on the registration page. Please verify that your payment has been received within one week of paying it (by checking the status on the registration form), and c<span><a class="bold" href="contact.html">contact us</a></span> if it hasn't.

                  The registration fee includes access to all sessions during the specified days, as well as catered lunch and coffee with snacks during the breaks. It will also include a conference bag (or equivalent) with information, and a conference t-shirt. We will do our best to accommodate the size preference as given on the registration form, but we cannot guarantee the exact same size.

                <p id="words" class="smallerwords">

                We are using paypal as our payment processor. Note that this does not require you to have a paypal account - you can pay either from an existing paypal account, or using any of the supported credit cards. If you use a credit card, you do not need to create a paypal account at all, you can pay directly from the payment link.
                </p>
                <h4 class="greyheader">TRAINING</h4>
                <p id="words" class="smallerwords">

                On Tuesday, we will also be providing training sessions. These are in-depth sessions, and cost an extra $150 per half-day session or $300 per full-day session. See the <span><a class="bold" href="training.html">training page</a></span> for more information.

                Participants in the training sessions are entitled to the discounted $200 rate for the rest of the conference, regardless of registration date. Training must be pre-paid using one of the standard methods - the pay at door method is not valid for training registrations.
                </p>
                <h4 class="greyheader">WHEN TO REGISTER</h4>
                <p id="words" class="smallerwords">
                We prefer if attendees register as soon as possible, as this makes the planning work much easier. And if you register during the early-bird period, it is also cheaper for you! Note that if you register too close to the conference, we cannot guarantee the availability of a conference bag and t-shirt for you, even if there are seats available at the conference!

                </p>
                <h4 class="greyheader">CANCELLATION</h4>
                <p id="words" class="smallerwords">
                If you need to cancel your registration after you have paid, please contact us for manual handling, just modifying the registration form will not cancel your registration.
                </br>
                If you cancel at least 4 weeks before the conference, we will refund you the full cost of the registration, minus any transaction fees.
                </br>
                If you cancel at least 2 weeks before the conference, we will refund you 50% of the cost of the registration, minus any transaction fees.
                </br>
                If you cancel less than 2 weeks before the conference, we will refund you 25% of the cost of the registration, minus any transaction fees.
                </p>
                <h4 class="greyheader">BULK PAYMENT</h4>
                <p id="words" class="smallerwords">
                We also have a bulk payment system available for those who wish to register multiple attendees and pay on a single invoice. This system is intended for companies who wish to send many employees or vendors/providers who wish to pay for their customers to go to the conference. As it includes more steps, it is recommended that the regular registration process is used when possible.

                To use the bulk payment system, please follow the following process:
                <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Each individual attendee uses the regular registration form to register, including filling out all details and possible additional options such as training. This is necessary since the connected account is used in all communication with the attendee, including participating in events and feedback. The attendee does not proceed to payment of the registration.</li>
                <li>The person in charge of payment (who does not need to be one of the attendees, but can be) proceeds to the bulk payment page, and fills in the invoicing details.</li>
                <li>The person in charge of payment fills in all the email addresses for the attendees to pay for on this page, validates that the total cost is correct, and generates an invoice. Generating the invoice locks all registrations against modifications, but just as with regular registrations they are not confirmed until the invoice is paid.</li>
                <li>The person in charge of payment pays the invoice using creditcard or paypal. Note that the invoice is due on receipt just like all other registrations.</li>
                <li>When the invoice is paid in the system, all attached registrations will automatically be confirmed, and the attendees added to the mailinglist. Only the person in charge of payment will receive a PDF copy of the receipt for the transaction.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h4 class="greyheader">PREPAID VOUCHERS</h4>
                <p id="words" class="smallerwords">
                Prepaid vouchers are issued to our sponsors, who can hand them out to employees or customers as necessary. Payment with a voucher is only valid for standard registrations, and can be used by simply clicking the button for prepaid voucher instead of regular payment. Once a regular payment has been started, it cannot be changed to a prepaid voucher later.

                If your company wishes to acquire prepaid vouchers beyond those offered to sponsors, please <span><a class="bold" href="contact.html">contact us</span></a>.
